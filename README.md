# 3d teapots!

3 sample program rendering teapots using DX9, DX10 and DX11. Each one does slightly different things based on the *hot* features at the time, like geometry shaders and the like.

Nothing super exciting, just some projects for my master's degree.

# Warning!
Probably doesn't build anymore, code is quite old.
